Hello again! This is my second real repository and project following "The Odin Project". This project will be to try and recreate the given landing page by using HTML and CSS. I am also most likely going to interpret some parts of the design to what I think looks best, rather than copying the example web page exactly. 

This link should bring you to the <span style="font-weight: bold">example</span> landing page I am expected to recreate: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png 

This link shold bring you to the current website page I've designed:
https://cdanti.github.io/odin-landing-page/ 

Note: You may notice a few different css styling files. This was done for clarity when reading and understanding the files. Each page is dedicated to a different section/layer of the webpage.
